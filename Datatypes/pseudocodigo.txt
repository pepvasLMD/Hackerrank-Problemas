Task

Java has 8 primitive data types; char, boolean, byte, short, int, long, float, and double. For this exercise, we'll work with the primitives used to hold integer values (byte, short, int, and long):

A byte is an 8-bit signed integer.
A short is a 16-bit signed integer.
An int is a 32-bit signed integer.
A long is a 64-bit signed integer.
Given an input integer, you must determine which primitive data types are capable of properly storing that input.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case, T, is comprised of a single line with an integer, n, which can be arbitrarily large or small.

	int: T
	long: n

Leer T

Mientras T > 0
	
	Leer n 

	Escribir("n can be fitted in:")

	Si n >=0 && n <= 255
		Escribir("* byte")

	Si n >= -32768 && n <= 32767
		Escribir("* short")

	Si n >= -2147483648 && n <= 2147483647
		Escribir("* int")

	Si n >= -9223372036854775808 && n <= 9223372036854775807
		Escribir("* long")
